January 22, 2018

It may seem like it's been a fairly quiet week on the surface but that's because the Hush/BTCH team has been in "heads down" mode. Here's what we've finished and what we're working on.

Critical updates:
[ul]
[li]The $BTCH snapshot was pushed back to Feb 1 due to community feedback on problems moving Hush to wallets. Although we don't support 3rd party products, we have a running dialogue in our [url=https://discord.gg/JrQUQAS]#support-wallets[/url] channel on Discord.[/li]
[/ul]


Completed projects:
[ul]
[li]SSL on btchush.org has been fixed.[/li]

[li]One of our community members put up a [url=http://www.btch.host/]$BTCH explorer[/url]. Be sure to check out the built-in [url=http://www.btch.host/richlist]rich list[/url].[/li]

[li]BTCH mainnet is online. Want to run your own $BTCH full node? We have [url=https://gist.github.com/leto/7fdc603ef84795863b7fe7859448c570]instructions on how to do that[/url].[/li] 
[/ul]


Development updates:
[ul]
[li]HushNG is progressing quickly. If you'd like to check it out, you can find the repo [url=https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng]here[/url]. If you'd like to help, we need help on [https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/issues/4]these items[/url].[/li]

[li]There will be a BTCH Whitepaper pre-release soon. The full whitepaper will be released after the snapshot so that it can include data from the snapshot date.[/li]

[li]Our web wallet is expecting an update this week in regards to max characters, translations, and potentially style.[/li]

[li]We have a [url=https://gist.github.com/clamoring/385c4237bad72fd207b70eab83a7c9f8]number of bounties[/url] that we can use a hand with. Please see the appropriate GitHub link for individual project status and point of contact and track us down in Discord.[/li]

News:

[li]BarterDEX was added to [url=https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/952650780296716289]coinmarketcap.com[/url].[/li]

[li]Zgold, a new [url=https://twitter.com/radix42/status/951540994603806720]airdrop[/url] for $HUSH holders has been announced. The snapshot date is Jan 3.
